- **history**: Saved dated GPU observations, reconciled with fresh offers without duplicate daily prices\.
- **providers**: Select the six requested GPU providers and exact H100/B200 model scope\.
- **collect**: Collect official GPU list rates, preserving machine totals, per\-GPU units, regions and purchase commitments\.
- **validate**: Check provider coverage and retain one dated observation per exact GPU offer\.
- **rentals**: Daily official GPU rental prices and scoped non\-listings\.

## Version history

- 2026-10-30T12:34:27.746768Z: v1: Added daily H100/B200 rental data across six providers, including explicit US and UK cloud prices\.
- 2026-10-30T17:10:46.129543Z: v2: Adds six GPU providers and A100, H200, L40S and MI300X coverage\. Completes Azure per\-GPU calculations and standardizes rental commitments while preserving daily price history\.
- 2026-10-30T17:25:49.479475Z: v3: Corrected Google Cloud billing\-column interpretation so unavailable on\-demand prices cannot inherit a Flex\-start rate\.
- 2026-10-30T18:26:24.970423Z: v4: Moved daily duplicate cleanup into every refresh, preserving saved history and normalizing equivalent numbers and commitment labels\.
- 2026-10-30T18:35:38.991961Z: v5: Corrected marketplace country labels and removed unsupported Google Cloud regional assignments in recurring collection and saved\-history reconciliation\.
